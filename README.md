I am presently engaged in a practice project aimed at creating a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to assist individuals in assessing and optimizing their personal budget planning. The primary technologies I will employ for this project include ReactJS, focusing on its core features. To manage the application's state, I will utilize the Context API, while for unit testing, React-Testing-Library and Jest will be my tools of choice.
