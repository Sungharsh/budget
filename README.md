## ðŸ”¥ Motivation

This is a practice project aimed at creating a Single Page Application (SPA) designed to assist individuals in assessing and optimizing their personal budget planning. The primary technologies I have employed for this project include ReactJS, focusing on its core features. To manage the application's state, I will utilize the Context API, while for unit testing, React-Testing-Library and Jest and for styling Material-UI and for charts MUI X-charts will be my tools of choice. There is a lot of scope to add more fetures and improve, but I have concluded fruther development on this app due to time constrains.
